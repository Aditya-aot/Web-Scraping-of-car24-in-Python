# Web-Scraping-in-Python-
I used Python 3  to Web scraping a site  Car24  to get data of different  cars and Save it to CSV File. 
🔍 Technical Deep Dive: Cars24 Web Scraper 🐍

Here's how I built my Cars24 data collection system:

📌 Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing
- Pandas for data structuring
- Requests library for HTTP communication
- Regular expressions for text processing

📌 Implementation Details:
1. Created a scraper that navigates through multiple pages of car listings
2. Built extraction functions for various data points including:
   - Car model & year
   - Engine specifications
   - Price and EMI options
   - Location and viewership data
   - Odometer readings & ownership history

📌 Data Processing:
- Used regex to clean messy text fields
- Structured data into a pandas DataFrame
- Exported clean, organized data to CSV

This project sharpened my skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and handling complex HTML structures while working with real-world data.
